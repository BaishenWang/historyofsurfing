 <h1> A history of surfing</h1>
<p>
  The art of surfing, called he enalu in the Hawaiian language, was first described in 1769  by Joseph Banks on the HMS Endeavour during the first voyage of Captain James Cook. Surfing was a central part of ancient Polynesian culture and predates European contact. The chief(Ali'i) was the most skilled waver rider in the community with the best board made from the best tree. The ruling class had the best beaches and the best boards, and the commoners were not allowed on the same beaches, but they could get prestige by their ability to ride the surf on their extremely heavy boards.
